# AquaPV
## Description
The AquaPV toolset provides foundational data and 
analyses for policymakers, developers, utilities, and 
financial firms seeking to understand floating PV (FPV) 
project viability on the United States (US) reservoirs 
and estuaries, assisting in scaling the systematic 
evaluation and implementation of this concept in the US.

The Techno-economic analysis tool provides a quick assessment
of the financial viability of a FPV project. Financial 
metrics that are available are payback period, return on investment
(ROI), net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), 
and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE).
